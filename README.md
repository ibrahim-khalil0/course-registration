I have declared total 5 states in this assignment project.

1. After loading data from the API, a state is declared to hold the data. I have saved all the data in it and passed the data from here as required.
2. Declare a state to store the selected courses and display the names of the selected courses from this state in the sidebar.
3. Declared a state to preserve credit time. It shows the user the total number of credit hours taken after selecting the course.
4. I have declared a state to show the user how much credit time is remaining after selecting a course.
5. Declaring a state to store the price of each selected course and displaying the data from the state to the user.
